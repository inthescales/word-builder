direct from latin:

NOUN derived:

war (bellum), varix/varicis (this seems to be rare?)
-icosus -> -icose
-icositas -> -icosity

money (pecunia)
-arius -> ary
-ousus -> ous

religion (religio, religionis)
-osus -> -ous
-ositas -> -osity

ADJ derived:

beautiful (pulchra - pulchritudo, pulchritudinis), grata, fortis, alta, others
-itudo -> -itude (nom)
-itudino -> -itudinous
(^ remember - these two are really the same. Nom vs. inflected)

cheerful (hilaris), absurdus
-itas -> -ity

happenstance (fortuitus)
-ous ????

animus (spirit or w/e)
animosus -> animous?
animositas -> animosity

----

observations:
adj. in -us can take -ity quite easily

transformations (that can't be represented with padding):
-ous + -ity -> -osity
-able + -ity -> -ability

SHIT:
anonymity (not anonymosity) (probably not latin?)

idea:
-ous is default, special exceptions use -icose.
Consider this for other affixes as well, if they're rare
